# Backlog

The harness's own next items. A change to a harness file (`PRINCIPLES.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `PLAN.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `design/`, `reviews/`,
`verification/`) or to the tool takes the review its mode requires through the
bootstrap (`PRINCIPLES.md`). There is no roadmap mechanism for the harness
itself — this file is it.

## Release 5 candidates

**Posting to GitHub is not optional — and it was done after the fact.** This
repository has a remote and the protocol says the same text is posted there,
but releases 1–4 opened no design issue before implementation: the design
records were posted as issues after the fact — #6–#8 once releases 1–3 had
merged, #5 just before release 4 merged — with their verdicts as comments, and
the implementation reviews were posted to PRs #1–#4 (after merge for #1–#3,
just before it for #4). The posted bodies are mis-encoded: issues #5–#8 turn
`—` and `·` into `ÔÇö` and `┬À`, PR #4 lost its dashes outright, and issue #5
and PR #4 start with a byte-order mark. The comments are intact; the bodies
differ from the canonical files.

1. **Assume a remote.** Reword the protocol: a remote is assumed; the design
   record is opened as the issue before implementation; each verdict is posted
   as a comment; the implementation review is posted on the pull request;
   without a remote the files stand alone. Reconsider the scaffold's `--github`
   default in the same change.
2. **Make it mechanical.** A small `tools/post-record.mjs` — given a design
   record, create the issue and post its verdict sections; given a pull request
   and review files, post them — so the step cannot be forgotten.
3. **The PR mechanics the field prompts already had**: the pull request links
   the design issue and names the revision the AGREE was given on; `Closes #N`
   on its own line; the four-part PR body; **no merge while a review is
   running**.

**Adoption.** Rebuild [`ADOPT.md`](ADOPT.md) by mining the six bootstrap prompts
in `harness_prompts` (interview first; demonstrate once on a real change; the
handover file; the PR mechanics; dry-run outward tooling).

**Planning.** An optional planner layer: a task catalogue (id, scope, `Owns`,
done-when, dependencies) with a planner session that proposes and maintains
tasks from a goal, and the owner approving the plan — the model for a project
whose builder does not know how to build it. Geoclick's plan-per-release
(Why / tasks with DoD / Order / a progress ledger / a product-decisions table)
is the middle shape; IC2's catalogue is the heavy end.

## Smaller items

- **Guard the `--test` value.** Reject a value with an unbalanced double quote
  or an embedded newline, with a hint about shell quoting.
- **A quoting note in `--help`.**
- **A review rule: reviews never execute a creation path.** A reviewer's fake
  CLI was bypassed and created a stray public repository.
- **Scratch-repository deletion** needs the token's `delete_repo` scope.

## Notes

- Adoption into an existing project is prompt-driven: [`ADOPT.md`](ADOPT.md). An
  `--into` adopt mode was considered and dropped — the project's own session
  knows the project, and a copy tool cannot reconcile the collisions.
- The root `PLAN.md` and `ROADMAP.md` are the *templates* a run receives, not
  this repository's own plans.
- Releases: `r1` (the consolidation), `r2` (field-test fixes), `r3` (the
  parametrizable scaffold), `r4` (the four lessons). Records in `design/` and
  `reviews/`.
